<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to unify the detailed member information across the application. Specifically, all the rich data displayed in the node card from the  should be integrated into the tabs and profile views within the . This includes detailed personal, medical, equipment, and device status information for each member.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A highly sophisticated, mobile-optimized React single-page application (OMEGA Dashboard) with a dark-mode UI. The entire frontend data layer is mocked.

The application features a comprehensive  which includes:
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** With , , and  roles, a role-switcher for testing, and access guards.
*   **Advanced Tabs:** An  tab with operational readiness snapshots, a full-featured  tab with search/filtering/sorting, and placeholders for Analytics, Comms, and Incident Reports.
*   **Team Builder:** A feature to automatically assemble optimal teams based on skill requirements.
*   **Drill Mode:** An interactive training mode for practicing emergency scenarios.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  (P0) Integrate detailed node card information into the Community Hub.
  - Issue 2:  (P1) Implement LOGS Observability P1 Features.
  - Issue 3:  (BLOCKED) Refactor lower-level tiles (, ).
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has identified the source components () and listed the numerous data points to be integrated (e.g., callsign, connection status, medical info, equipment loadout, device stats).
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1.  Update the mock data schema in  to include all the new fields from the node card.
        2.  Expand the mock  array with realistic data for these new fields.
        3.  Modify the  component in the Directory to show key new indicators (e.g., user status, connection type).
        4.  Update the  component to display the full, detailed information, mimicking the layout of the .
        5.  Extend the  privacy helper to cover new sensitive data points like medical conditions and precise location.
        6.  Verify the UI across all Community Hub tabs remains functional and responsive after the data model change.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will create a single, unified, and data-rich view of each member across the application, making the Community Hub the definitive source for operational readiness and member status.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React.js, React Hooks (, , , ).
-   **Styling:** Advanced dark mode theme using Tailwind CSS and .
-   **State Management:** Complex local component state. The growing complexity highlights the need for refactoring or a state management library.
-   **Data Modeling:** Evolving a complex, nested mock data structure to serve a feature-rich UI.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (Frontend-only). The mock  model in  is being expanded to include:
    -   
    -    (GOOD, OKAY, etc.)
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -

**All files of reference**
-   **Heavily Rewritten/Updated in this session:**
    -   : Has undergone multiple major feature additions and is the primary focus.
-   **Created in this session:**
    -   : Centralizes all mock data for the hub.
-   **To be referenced for current task:**
    -   : The template for the new data structure.
-   **Updated:**
    -   

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is now over 3,000 lines long and handles logic for all tabs, modals, and features. It urgently needs to be broken down into smaller, self-contained components (e.g., , , , ) to maintain sanity and improve performance.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** The current task is to integrate the rich profile data from the  into the . Start by updating the mock data in , then update the UI components (, ) in .
-   **REFACTORING IS CRITICAL:** The  component has become a monolith. While implementing the new data models, you should concurrently refactor the component, breaking out tabs and major features into their own files. This will be essential for long-term maintenance.
-   **PRIVACY IS PARAMOUNT:** The new data includes sensitive information (e.g., medical conditions). Ensure the existing  privacy system is properly extended to cover all new sensitive fields.
