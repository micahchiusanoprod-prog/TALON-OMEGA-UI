<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to build a single-page, offline-first web dashboard called OMEGA Dashboard. The project has evolved significantly, with recent work focusing on two major features:

1.  **LOGS True Observability Upgrade:** The user requested a massive enhancement of the  page to include incident intelligence, root-cause analysis, detection rules, and more. The Priority 0 (P0) features of this upgrade have been completed.
2.  **Community Hub (Current Task):** The user has now provided a new, highly detailed specification for a Community page, which supersedes a previous, simpler version of the request. This new feature is to be built in a phased approach, starting with robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and privacy features.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A sophisticated, mobile-optimized React single-page application with a dark-mode UI. All frontend data is mocked.

Key implemented features include:
*   A redesigned Camera Tile with on-demand capture modes.
*   A comprehensive, searchable Help Center.
*   A full-featured Music Player.
*   **LOGS Observability (P0):** The  page has been significantly upgraded with the following P0 features:
    *   **Capture Health Panel:** Displays the status and health of the data collection process.
    *   **Detection Rules Panel:** Allows configuration of thresholds for anomaly detection.
    *   **Incidents Sub-Tab:** A new section featuring an incident timeline, a filterable list, and a new badge on the tab indicating the number of open incidents.
    - **Incident Detail Drawer:** A comprehensive slide-out panel showing an incident's summary, root-cause drivers, likely causes, an operator-friendly verification checklist, and resolution notes.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Starting the implementation of the new, phased Community Hub feature. The agent was instructed to begin with **Phase 0 (RBAC, Privacy, Data Contracts)** and **Phase 1 (Foundation & Navigation)**. The agent analyzed the existing (and now outdated)  and  to prepare for a complete rewrite.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  (P0) Implement the Community Hub feature (Phase 0 & 1).
  - Issue 2:  (P1) Implement LOGS Observability P1 Features.
  - Issue 3:  (BLOCKED) Refactor lower-level tiles (, ).
  - Issue 4:  (USER VERIFICATION PENDING) Fix for  mobile layout.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent recognized that the existing  is obsolete and needs to be replaced entirely to meet the new, detailed requirements.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Create a new component for the Community Hub ().
        2. Implement the RBAC model (guest, member, admin) using a mocked  object.
        3. Define and use the specified data models for profiles and incidents, including privacy opt-in flags for sensitive data.
        4. Add the Community button to .
        5. Build the sub-tab navigation within the hub: Overview, Analytics, Directory, Comms, and Incident Reports.
        6. Verify that the Incident Reports tab is hidden for non-admin roles.
        7. Verify that privacy redaction correctly hides sensitive data based on user opt-in flags.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is the user's current highest-priority feature. Completing Phase 0 & 1 will provide a secure, role-aware foundation for the rest of the feature.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: N/A.
     - Next debug checklist: Await user confirmation to begin work on the P1 features for the LOGS page, which include Anomaly Feed Upgrades, Annotations, Report Generator, and a Service Reliability Panel.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To complete the user's vision for the True Observability center.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: User has explicitly locked the scope to P0 for now.
  - Issue 3: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent previously analyzed the tiles and concluded that a generic refactor would be a functional regression.
     - Status:  BLOCKED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: User clarification is needed.
  - Issue 4: 
     - Attempted fixes: The layout was fixed using a horizontally scrolling flex container.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  (P0) Build the Community Hub Foundation (Phase 0 & 1).

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: Begin by creating a new  component from scratch, as the existing  is outdated. Implement the RBAC system and data models as per the user's Phase 0 requirements. Then, modify  and build the tab navigation shell as per Phase 1.
     - What will be achieved with this? A testable UI shell for the Community Hub with correct RBAC, privacy redaction, and mocked data shapes, ready for the implementation of subsequent phases.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React.js, React Hooks (, , ).
-   **Styling:** Advanced dark mode theme using Tailwind CSS.
-   **State Management:** Local component state, with heavy use of  for derived data like anomalies and incidents.
-   **RBAC & Privacy:** A new critical requirement for the Community Hub, to be implemented with a mocked user object and privacy flags to control UI and data visibility.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (Frontend-only). The following models have been defined for mocking:
    -   **LOGS Incident:** 
    -   **Community Profile:**  (New Requirement)
    -   **Community Incident:**  (New Requirement)

**All files of reference**
-   **Heavily Rewritten/Updated:**
    -   : Overhauled to add all P0 observability features.
-   **To be Rewritten/Created:**
    -   : Is obsolete and will be replaced by a new component for the Community Hub.
-   **To be Modified:**
    -   : To add and manage the state for the new Community Hub.
-   **Updated:**
    -   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** The top priority is building the **Community Hub**, starting with **Phase 0 (RBAC & Privacy)** and **Phase 1 (Navigation Shell)**. The user has explicitly locked the scope to these two phases for the initial delivery.
-   **RBAC IS NON-NEGOTIABLE:** Correctly implementing the role model (guest/member/admin) and privacy redaction from the very beginning is a critical requirement for the Community Hub. Use a mocked  to test role-switching.
-   **REPLACE, DON'T MODIFY:** The existing  is outdated. You must create a new component from scratch that follows the new phased plan.
-   **LOGS P0 IS COMPLETE:** The previous task to upgrade the LOGS page is considered complete for P0. Do not work on the P1/P2 LOGS features until the user gives explicit approval after reviewing the Community Hub progress.
